This directory is currently (mostly) empty in the revision control.
All of the graphics and various other files are derived from the games
Battle for Wesnoth and Chromium B.S.U. If you have those games installed,
you can create the assets by typing:

../tools/makeassets .

from this directory. It will expect Wesnoth is located in
/usr/share/games/wesnoth/data,
and Chromium is located in
/usr/share/games/chromium.

If they located somewhere else, pass them on the command line to makeassets.

Other assets (stored in the 'work' directory):
